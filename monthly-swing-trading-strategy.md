# 📆 Monthly Swing Trading Strategy

**Theme:** *Momentum. Structure. Capital Protection.*  
**Mindset:** *Trade less. Win big. Lose small. No FOMO. No Anchoring Bias. No Gambler’s Fallacy.*

Even if **8 out of 10 trades are losers**, the **2 winners** should pay for everything—and more.  
This strategy is built for monthly chart traders who want clarity, conviction, and compounding gains.

## 🔒 1. Start in Cash & Protect Capital
- Cash is your default position.  
- No setup? No trade.  
- Preserve your principal—it's your edge.  
- Sitting out is a strategy. **No FOMO. No Anchoring Bias. No Gambler’s Fallacy.**

## 🚦 2. Scan for Fresh Momentum
- Focus on strong price action over the past 1–2 months.  
- Look for clean breakouts, bullish engulfing candles, or closes above resistance.  
- Momentum must be *new*, not exhausted.  
- **No FOMO entries. No Anchoring Bias to past highs or lows. No Gambler’s Fallacy—momentum doesn’t guarantee continuation.**

## 📊 3. Use Volume Profile & Confirm Volume Trend
- **HVNs** = consolidation zones → ideal for entries.  
- **LVNs** = rejection zones → use for exits or avoid resistance.  
- Look for **month-over-month volume increases**, even if below average.  
- Rising volume signals early accumulation and validates price strength.  
- Don’t anchor to past volume spikes—**read the current trend**.  
- **Avoid Gambler’s Fallacy**—just because volume was low last month doesn’t mean it must rise this month.

## 📈 4. Lean In When Strength Persists
- If momentum continues into month 2 or 3:  
  - Add to your position.  
  - Use trailing stops.  
- This is where conviction meets opportunity.  
- **No Anchoring Bias to your entry price—trade what’s in front of you.**  
- **No Gambler’s Fallacy—don’t assume a trend will reverse just because it’s been running.**

## 🧯 5. Exit on Weakness
- Watch for shrinking candles, declining volume, or failed breakouts.  
- Sell into strength—not weakness.  
- **No FOMO on the way down. No Anchoring Bias to targets. No Gambler’s Fallacy—weakness can continue.**

## ✂️ 6. Cut Losers Fast
- If price breaks support or stalls, exit.  
- Most trades will fail—accept it and move on.  
- **8 losses, 2 wins—that’s the math.**  
- **No FOMO. No Anchoring Bias. No Gambler’s Fallacy—just because it dropped doesn’t mean it’s “due” to bounce.**

## 🧠 7. Stay Detached & Disciplined
- Don’t cling to trades that aren’t working.  
- Let go of emotional bias.  
- Review charts monthly—ignore daily noise.  
- Discipline protects capital.  
- **No FOMO. No Anchoring Bias. No Gambler’s Fallacy. No drama.**
